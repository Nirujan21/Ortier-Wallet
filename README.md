# Ortier-Wallet

Ortier is a technology company based from Toronto, Canada. My name is Nirujan I am the ceo and founder of Ortier, I have started my journey in 2015 in cryptocurrency.

I want to now build applications to help users understand what private keys are, how easy it to transfer and use money. Our goal at Ortier is to create an easily accessible mobile wallet for users to hold funds & play games! Wallet will be multi chain, multi coin with custom address and storage for files and contact information.


Banking lending, exchange, games, chat, storage for files and media.
